Project on Eye Directive WheelChair
The Eye Directive wheelchair is a mobility-aided device for persons with moderate/severe physical disabilities or
chronic diseases as well as for the elderly. There are various interfaces for wheelchair available in the market, still
they remain under-utilized, the reason being the ability, power and mind presence required to operate them. The
proposed model is a possible alternative. In this model, we use the optical-type eye tracking system to control
powered wheel chair. User’s eye movements are translated to screen position using the optical type eye tracking
system, without any direct contact. When user looks at appropriate angle, then computer input system will send
command to the software based on the angle of rotation of pupil i.e., when user moves his eyes balls left (move left),
right (move right), straight (move forward) in all other cases wheel chair will stop. Also, obstacle detection sensors
are connected to the arduino to provide necessary feedback for proper operation of the wheelchair and to ensure the
user’s safety. The motors attached to the wheelchair support differential steering which avoids clumsy motion. The
wheelchair has also been provided with a joystick control to ensure safe movement in case of tired vision and with a
safety stop button, which will enable the user to stop the wheelchair at his own ease.
